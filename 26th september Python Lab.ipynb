    "1. **`class PowerCalculator:`**\n",
    "   - This defines a new class named `PowerCalculator`. A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects, which can contain methods (functions) and attributes (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`def pow(self, x, n):`**\n",
    "   - This defines a method called `pow` within the `PowerCalculator` class. The method takes two arguments: `x`, which is the base, and `n`, which is the exponent. `self` refers to the instance of the class that calls this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`return x ** n`**\n",
    "   - This line calculates `x` raised to the power of `n` using Python's built-in exponentiation operator `**`. The result of this calculation is then returned by the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "- **`calculator = PowerCalculator()`**\n",
    "  - This line creates an instance of the `PowerCalculator` class, stored in the variable `calculator`. An instance is an individual object created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`print(calculator.pow(2, 3))`**\n",
    "  - This line calls the `pow` method of the `calculator` object with `x=2` and `n=3`. The method computes `2` raised to the power of `3`, which equals `8`. The `print` function then outputs this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- The class `PowerCalculator` contains a single method `pow` that uses Python’s built-in `**` operator to calculate and return the power of a number.\n",
    "- The example demonstrates creating an object from the `PowerCalculator` class and using it to calculate the power of `2` raised to `3`, resulting in `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple class is designed to encapsulate the power calculation into a reusable component. The method itself leverages Python's straightforward syntax for exponentiation, making the code easy to read and understand."
